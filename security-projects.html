            <h2>PoC of a Super Resilient C&C Communication Based on Reddit</h2>
            <h3>Team academic project in Cyber Security with Barak Sofir, supervised by Amichai Shulman</h3>
            <p>In this project we implemented a PoC of a super resilient C&C two-way communication based on public infrastructure in a
                cost-effective way. The C&C is based on comments on Reddit content and is extremely difficult to detect
                and very hard to dismantle.</p>
            <p>The project was nominated for an Excellent Project Award in the Computer Science Faculty at the Technion.
