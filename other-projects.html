                <h3 class="project-supervision">Team academic project in DNA Data Storage with Adi Tzhori, supervised by Omer Sabary and Gadi Chaykin</h3>
                <p class="project-description">
                    In this project, we built and integrated the Maskless Array Synthesis (MAS) simulator into an existing DNA synthesis simulator developed within the DNA Storage Lab, led by Prof. Eitan Yaakobi, at the Computer Science Faculty at the Technion.
                    The MAS simulator provides a cost-effective and versatile alternative to physical MAS synthesis, making it a valuable tool for advancing research in DNA data storage.
                    By reducing financial constraints associated with physical experiments, it opens up new opportunities for in-depth studies of MAS processes.
                    Rigorous testing confirmed the accuracy of the simulator through individual and combined error rate analyses, demonstrating close alignment with predefined values.
                    This attests to the simulator's reliability. Our versatile simulator shows promise in furthering our understanding of DNA synthesis, error rates, and their implications, ultimately contributing to the field of DNA data storage.

                    This website is a personal project I created out of curiosity and a desire to expand my knowledge.
                    I ventured into web development to learn how websites are built and build one for myself.
                    The website is a platform to showcase my coding portfolio, highlighting my skills and experience.
                    It reflects my learning journey and demonstrates my ability to apply programming skills in different domains.
