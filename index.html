                <h2>Learning to Predict the Utility of Subset Patterns</h2>
                <p>Project in AI, supervised by Shaul Markovitch</p>
                <p>
                    In this project we present an innovative method for intelligent subset initialization. It involves a meticulous curation of the initial subset,
                    driven by comprehensive evaluation of each element's contribution to the subset's objective. Our aim is to understand intricate interdependencies among elements,
                    enabling precise impact measurement. We offer two algorithms: one assesses elements individually,
                    and the second, more advanced, considers interdependencies and patterns in subsets for calculating element contributions.

                <h2>Research of Super-Resilient C&C System Based on Reddit</h2>
                <p>Project in Cyber-security, supervised by Amichai Shulman</p>
                <p>
                    We have developed a sophisticated C&C insfrastructure that seamlessly integrates into the existing infrastructure or Reddit,
                    by concealing the command messages in comments on existing content. This innovative approach effectively hides the communication in plain sight.
                    Leveraging the search functionality of Reddit, we established a link between the controller and the bot.
                    This is accomplished by using everyday keywords embedded within the command message.
                    Intriguingly, commands are identified only by these keywords and not by the user that posted the comment,
                    making it harder to detect or dismantle the infrastructure. Each control message serves as a breadcrumb to the next -
                    by incorporating the keywords for the subsequent command into the current one, creating a continuous and hard-to-detect chain of commands.
                    We have made a significant finding that it is possible to create a Reddit account using a false email address,
                    combined with breaking through the reCAPTCHA security measure. This revelation allowed us to establish an under the-radar reverse communication channel
                    from the bot back to the controller, based on comments as well. Interestingly, not only do our comments comply with Reddit's policy,
                    but they also prompt positive interactions from legitimate users. This unexpected engagement stands as compelling evidence that our covert infrastructure effectively remains undetectable.
