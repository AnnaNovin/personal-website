                Hi! I'm Anna
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a recent graduate from Technion with BSc in Computer Science with a strong research background.
                I have a keen interest in Cyber Security and Artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I work as a Student Software Developer at Rafael Advances Defense Systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that, I served for 4 years at the IDF at the 8200 unit. I started out as an analyst in an Intelligence Production Team, and then went to Officer Courses.
                I held two positions as an officer, first as Head of Intelligence Production Department and then as Cyber and Intelligence Project Manager.
                In the last position I got a lot of experience in the cyber field, and I enjoyed the work a lot.
                So, I decided to study for a BSc in Computer Science at the Technion.

                In my free time I enjoy horse riding and traveling. Also, I have a darling cat by the name of Cleo.
